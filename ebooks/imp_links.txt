https://twiki.polycom.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RetrievingCoreDumpsFromThePhone



Debugging with gdb and DDD: The simplest instructions in the world. 
There are a number of gdb and DDD instructions on the twiki, but they are not only erroneous but also complicated and subject to variations, so I decided to simplify and standardize gdb and DDD startup process. Without further ado, here it is. 
Set up target. 
1. In Engineering serial shell, issue de to disable watchdog. That's it. 
•	Previously it was stated that it is also necessary to kill /usr/local/bin/plcmWatchdog and /bin/sh ./startSpipGUI.sh processes, but it's not really necessary, so don't do it unless you experience a problem. 
2. If you do not know target IP address, in Engineering serial shell do the following: 
•	linux sh 
•	ifconfig -a | grep inet | grep -v "127.0.0.1" 
•	The "inet addr" is your target IP address. 
•	exit 
3. ssh into the target. 
•	ssh -l root {target IP address} on the host. 
•	You will need to know the secret root password. 
•	If you do not know it, get into Linux bash shell on the serial port or telnet by entering linux sh command in Engineering shell. 
4. Look up the process you want to debug. 
•	ps | grep {process name} 
5. If you will be debugging the process from scratch by starting it up again, kill the already running one. Then start it with gdbserver. 
•	kill -9 {process ID} or pkill {process name} 
•	/usr/local/bin/gdbserver :{port} {executable} 
•	For example: /usr/local/bin/gdbserver :2345 /usr/local/root/polyapp 
6. If you will be attaching to already running process, attach to it with gdbserver. 
•	/usr/local/bin/gdbserver --attach :{port} {process ID from step 3} 
•	For example: /usr/local/bin/gdbserver --attach :2345 1019 
7. Your target is now waiting for gdb to connect to it. 
Set up host. 
1. Go to SoundPointIP/IPPhone/Build/HostLinux directory. 
2. To debug with gdb: 
•	./gdb.sh {platform},{target IP address}:{target port of gdbserver} {unstripped executable} 
•	For example: ./gdb.sh bcmring.malbec,10.10.10.10:2345 ../../Generated/Binaries/malbec-glibc_small-armv6jel-wrlinux_3_0/polyapp 
•	For example: ./gdb.sh bcmring.malbec ../../Generated/Binaries/malbec-glibc_small-armv6jel-wrlinux_3_0/polyapp. Then issue target remote 10.10.10.10:2345 once gdb is running. 
3. To debug with DDD (graphical front-end to gdb; you need to have DDD package installed on your host): 
•	./ddd.sh {platform},{target IP address}:{target port of gdbserver} {unstripped executable} 
•	For example: ./ddd.sh bcmring.malbec,10.10.10.10:2345 ../../Generated/Binaries/malbec-glibc_small-armv6jel-wrlinux_3_0/polyapp 
•	For example: ./ddd.sh bcmring.malbec ../../Generated/Binaries/malbec-glibc_small-armv6jel-wrlinux_3_0/polyapp. Then issue target remote 10.10.10.10:2345 once DDD/gdb is running. 
4. Note Remote debugging from host {host IP} message appearing on the target after DDD/gdb attaches to it. 
5. Ignore messages along the lines of: 
warning: .dynamic section for "/other/extra/generic/SoundPointIP/IPPhone/Generated/Build/platform/malbec-glibc_small-armv6jel-wrlinux_3_0/export/sysroot/malbec-glibc_small/sysroot/lib/librt.so.1" is not at the expected address
warning: difference appears to be caused by prelink, adjusting expectations
6. If info shared command indicates that shared libraries have not been loaded: 
•	May not be an issue, but occurs if debugged process is started from scratch rather than attached to. 
•	If you need them loaded or think they should be loaded, execute sharedlibrary or just share command. 
7. That's it, happy debugging. 
8. Do not forget to detach from the target when you are done; otherwise debugged process will be killed. 
•	Enter detach command in gdb or do the same in DDD via File->Detach Process menu. 
9. Quit gdb (quit command) or close DDD.

Kernel Patch Submission tutorial
Posted on November 26, 2015 
Getting your patch submitted in Linux kernel could be one of the most satisfying job for a newbie Linux kernel developer. Until my first patch got in to mainline I was not knowing that this could be a very easy task as it seems to be.
There are many ways to submit a patch to Linux community, but will not discuss all of them as it could be very confusing. I have gone through all and came up with one most sure shot procedure.
Ok, so here is to the point step by step guide to submit your first linux kernel patch, and have your name in Linux kernel :)
I am considering you are doing all this in Ubuntu machine, for other flavors please tweak the commands accordingly.
________________________________________
 I. Tools Set up
________________________________________
    1) Install git : version control system for your Linux kernel
sudo apt-get install git
    2) Install git mail : you will be requiring this to send patches to Linux community
sudo apt-get install git-email
    3) Config git : create a file at your home directory vim ~/.gitconfig, and have the below details in it
[user]
name = Saurabh Sengar
email = saurabh.truth@gmail.com
[sendemail]
smtpencryption = tls
smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
smtpuser = saurabh.truth@gmail.com
smtpserverport = 587
smtppass = XXXXXX
The above example is for my gmail id configuration to git. Change my email ids and names with yours, change smtp server if your are using an email other then gmail, but Heay ! who doesn’t have gmail id ? keep it simple :). And yeah don’t forget to write your actual gmail login password in place of XXXXXX, yes that’s right you heard it correct ;)
    4) Enable access for less secure apps in gmail : This is a very important step, otherwise gmail will not let you send your mails via git email client. So, to do this log in to your gmail id, and in same browser enter the below url.
https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps
It will show the option to ‘Turn on’ your access of less secure apps, select that !
________________________________________
II. Download Linux kernel
________________________________________
Go to your home directory, or any folder where you want to keep your linux kernel repository, run the below commands
git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
This will take some time, go watch some movie and come back, don’t worry I will be waiting here.
________________________________________
 III. Creating a Patch
________________________________________
You have your changes ready ? in case you are not sure what you need to submit go to section V to know how all you begin to create the patches for contributing to linux kernel.
Say, you want to change the file ” drivers/staging/iio/iio_simple_dummy_buffer.c”
1 ) Do your changes in file and save it
vim drivers/staging/iio/iio_simple_dummy_buffer.c
2) Add the changes to your git
git add drivers/staging/iio/iio_simple_dummy_buffer.c
3) Commit your changes
git commit -s -v
You need to add a subject and description of changes you have made in patch. Do a git log of the file you have changed in order to get the format of subject and description for that particular file
Thing to make sure is that your sign-off tag should be there in this patch, anyway -s argument of above command will take care of it don’t worry.
4) Whom to send : Get the maintainers email ids by running get_maintainer script on your patch or file you changed
./script/get_maintainer.pl -f  drivers/staging/iio/iio_simple_dummy_buffer.c
./script/get_maintainer.pl –patch /tmp/0001-test.patch
copy these mail ids
And next section will be about sending your patch to linux community, but before that make sure your changes doesn’t have any coding style issues, this can be checked by script ./script/checkpatch.pl
./script/checkpatch.pl -f drivers/staging/iio/iio_simple_dummy_buffer.c
./script/checkpatch.pl –patch /tmp/0001-test.patch
 
________________________________________
IV. Sending The Patch
________________________________________
This is easy
git send-email –annotate HEAD^1
it will prompt for email ids whom to sent, paste the email ids copied “whom to send” section. It may also ask for ‘in reply to’ you can just avoid it by pressing enter for first patch as this option is for replying on an existing mail chain. Then for final confirmation it will ask, press ‘y’ … hit enter …. and YOU ARE DONE !! :)
After some 10 -15 minutes you can see your patch in lkml.org site, good start :). And if every thing goes fine soon your patch will be merged in mainline. Depending on the complexity of patch and availability of maintainers your patch can be given feed back ranging from 1 minute to 20 days. In case you don’t get any feedback ping them back, but at least give around 20 days to Linux Kernel Maintainers to respond.
________________________________________
VI. What to submit
________________________________________
I would suggest to start your patch submission from driver/staging directory, until you are confident enough on how to send patches.
You can run some static analyzer tool in order to fix there errors, but keep in mind that there could be many false positives to report by them. So, the output of these tools should be looked with care.
Run Checkpatch.pl on kernel, and fix the errors/warnings reported by it, these are many.
Run coccicheck: http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/
And if you are confident in some module or framework of linux kernel, go review them and in case you feel you can make them better go ahead and do the changes.
And as the last advice I can give you while interacting with Linux kernel developers in lkml, be patient and be humble :)
Get your hands dirty and let me know if you need any help in comments section.
 
Hope this helps,
Saurabh Singh Sengar
